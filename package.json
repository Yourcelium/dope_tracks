Search for them with your favorite text editors. * `spotify_test/urls.py`   * Where we create our OAuth callback urls and some test routes. * `core/decorators.py`   * The `@spotify_view` decorator is defined here which refreshes an instance of an OAuth token and passes it to the view.   * It also checks if the user is authenticated! * `info/views.py`   * 2 Views to display how it works.   * Super simple!",
